## The 8 Pillars of Positive Peace through the Lens of the Ipetu/Ife Community in Osun State Nigeria.

### Introduction
---
This project was designed to research and analyze the Ipetu/Ife Community under the lens of the [Institute for Economics and Peace](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/) Positive Peace Framework, in order to identify points that can be leveraged to create systemic, sustainable and positive change. The goal is to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities across the 8 Pillars of Positive Peace in the Ipetu/Ife Community.

**What is Positive Peace?**
  Positive Peace is the presence of conditions that prevent violence and conflict from arising in the first place. According to the IEP, Positive Peace addresses the underlying factors that sustain peaceful and prosperous societies, such as equitable resource distribution, functioning government, and social cohesion. It differs from Negative Peace which simply refers to the absence of war. Through its empirical research and data-driven approach, the IEP developed a Positive Peace Framework to assess and develop positive peace in communities, organizations, and States. This birthed the 8 Pillars of Positive Peace, through which this research and analysis was conducted.
